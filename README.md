What is our app
In our app users can collect and share their crafting ideas with others and they can browse through the ideas and get inspiration.

In the last Sprint...
- We agreed on a name for our app, it is no longer just the second D.I.Y app, now the name of our baby is WoodWorm
- We added the feature to upload images, and every project now displays an image in the overview, and on it’s own detail page
- We updated our database in MongoDB, and the code of our App to:
- Display instructions for every project in a step-by-step way
- And the Tools and Material are now displayed as lists
- We of course also edited our Form inputs for the instructions, Tools and Material

In the next Sprint...
- We want to update our filter section, to make it more user friendly
- We also want to add a User profile page, that shows only those projects that the user created themself
- Afterwards we only want the creator of a project to be able to edit and delete that project
- And maybe, if there is time left we want to at some styling to our app

Our Learnings are that...
- Sometimes just exiting a sever in Node.js, by entering “Control C“, can prevent frustration and so many headaches
- Joking around and a good team spirit, makes the whole Capstone process a pleasent experience. SOFT SKILLS is the keyword 
- Helping out other teams with their problems is fun, and also strengthens your own knowledge, in the subject matter 
- We waited in the last sprint for code reviews more than we actually solved problems, so we leaned that patience is a very crucial and hard skill to develop in programming
